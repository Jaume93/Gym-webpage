# GYM v1.0

This is the third project of Let's Coder Bootcamp.     
This project is dedicated to represent a Gym webpage with its functions and utilities.    
    
The Technologies used in this website are the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- Postman
- JavaScript
- Node js

## Utilities of the page
First of all the user can interact with the gym webpage by **singning in** or **loging in** in case it would have a membership. Then it can select **membership fee** that fits better to its needs depending on services or activites. After the user has signed in and selected a membership fee, the member can **book different activities** to do during the day.
